Implemented a simple project which constructs a cube using 6 squares. 

The cube is then continuously scaled and rotated.

There is a menu with 2 options for the rotation of the cube ( right click ) which allows to select between: 

a) the cube spinning around itself (default)

b) the cube spinning around the arbitrary point (0, 0, -72) and axis (1, 0, 1)
